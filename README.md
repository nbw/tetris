# Tetris (for OP-Z)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/78e5fcc6-04d0-4f41-a46c-b0002b727712/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ecstatic-lamarr-0706a7/deploys)

Implements Tetris and uses [OPZjs](github.com/nbw/opz) to parse input from the OP-Z.

## Personal note about the code

I'm not expecting to win any awards for graceful HTML/CSS design here. But it works and uses plain ol' Javascript.

## Development Notes

### Building Javascript Assets

1. Node
2. Install browserify

```
npm install -g browserify
```

3. Install deps (mostly Babel)

```
npm install
```

4. Build script.js

```
npm run build
```

## OP-Z Assets

Feel free to use the OP-Z assets in the project. I made them myself.

If you want the Adobe Illustrator file contact me.
